# Do-Work Skill

A unified entry point for task capture and processing.

**Actions:**
- **do**: Capture new tasks/requests → creates UR folder (verbatim input) + REQ files (queue items), always paired
- **work**: Process pending requests → executes the queue
- **verify**: Evaluate captured REQs against original input → quality check
- **cleanup**: Consolidate archive → moves loose REQs into UR folders, closes completed URs

> **Core concept:** The do action always produces both a UR folder (preserving the original input) and REQ files (the queue items). Each REQ links back to its UR via `user_request` frontmatter. This pairing is mandatory for all requests — simple or complex.

## Routing Decision

### Step 1: Parse the Input

Examine what follows "do work":

| Pattern | Example | Route |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Empty or bare invocation | `do work` | → Ask: "Start the work loop?" |
| Action verbs only | `do work run`, `do work go`, `do work start` | → work |
| Verify keywords | `do work verify`, `do work check`, `do work evaluate` | → verify |
| Cleanup keywords | `do work cleanup`, `do work tidy`, `do work consolidate` | → cleanup |
| Descriptive content | `do work add dark mode`, `do work [meeting notes]` | → do |
| Version keywords | `do work version`, `do work update`, `do work check for updates` | → version |

### Step 2: Preserve Payload

**Critical rule**: Never lose the user's content.

If routing is unclear BUT content was provided:
- Default to **do** (adding a task)
- Hold onto $ARGUMENTS
- If truly ambiguous, ask: "Add this as a request, or start the work loop?"
- User replies with just "add" or "work" → proceed with original content

### Action Verbs (→ Work)

These signal "process the queue":
run, go, start, begin, work, process, execute, build, continue, resume

### Verify Verbs (→ Verify)

These signal "check request quality":
verify, check, evaluate, review requests, review reqs, audit

Note: "check" routes to verify ONLY when used alone or with a target (e.g., "do work check UR-003"). When followed by descriptive content it routes to do (e.g., "do work check if the button works" → do).

### Cleanup Verbs (→ Cleanup)

These signal "consolidate the archive":
cleanup, clean up, tidy, consolidate, organize archive, fix archive

### Content Signals (→ Do)

These signal "add a new task":
- Descriptive text beyond a single verb
- Feature requests, bug reports, ideas
- Screenshots or context
- "add", "create", "I need", "we should"

## Examples

### Routes to Work
- `do work` → "Ready to process the queue?" (confirmation)
- `do work run` → Starts work action immediately
- `do work go` → Starts work action immediately

### Routes to Verify
- `do work verify` → Evaluates most recent UR's REQs
- `do work verify UR-003` → Evaluates specific UR
- `do work check REQ-018` → Evaluates the UR that REQ-018 belongs to
- `do work evaluate` → Evaluates most recent UR's REQs
- `do work review requests` → Evaluates most recent UR's REQs

### Routes to Cleanup
- `do work cleanup` → Consolidates archive, closes completed URs
- `do work tidy` → Same as cleanup
- `do work consolidate` → Same as cleanup

### Routes to Do
- `do work add dark mode` → Creates REQ file + UR folder
- `do work the button is broken` → Creates REQ file + UR folder
- `do work [400 words]` → Creates REQ files + UR folder with full verbatim input

## Payload Preservation Rules

When clarification is needed but content was provided:

1. **Do not lose $ARGUMENTS** - keep the full payload in context
2. **Ask a simple question**: "Add this as a request, or start the work loop?"
3. **Accept minimal replies**: User says just "add" or "work"
4. **Proceed with original content**: Apply the chosen action to the stored arguments
5. **Never ask the user to re-paste content**

This enables a two-phase commit pattern:
1. Capture intent payload
2. Confirm action

## Action References

Follow the detailed instructions in:

- [work action](./actions/work.md) - Queue processing
- [verify action](./actions/verify.md) - Quality evaluation of captured requests
- [cleanup action](./actions/cleanup.md) - Archive consolidation and UR closure
- [version action](./actions/version.md) - Version & updates
